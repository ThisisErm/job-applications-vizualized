# job-applications-vizualized

## Experimenting with data vizualization with Grafana.

### The dashboard was built on a self-hosted Grafana Docker container. I used a Google sheet spreadsheet as the database and exported to Grafana using the Google sheets API. I then exported each dashboard as a snapshot from Grafana and imported them as iframe elements into an html document, then deployed via netlify.

### Here is the live dashboard with data table and minimal dark-mode styling: https://grafana-job-applications.netlify.app/
